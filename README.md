# Apache Beam Demo (Python, Colab)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/samipn/apache-beam-demo/blob/main/apache_beam_colab_demo.ipynb)

A tiny, hands-on intro to **Apache Beam (Python SDK)**, packaged as a single Google Colab notebook. Use it to learn how Beam pipelines are built and run locally with the **DirectRunner**, and to experiment interactively without setting up a local environment.

## Quick start

### Run in Google Colab
1. Click the badge at the top or open the notebook directly: `apache_beam_colab_demo.ipynb`.
2. In Colab, run the first setup cell (it installs `apache-beam` into the runtime).
3. Execute cells top-to-bottom and tweak the example pipeline(s) as you go.
